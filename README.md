# dmlvis
Computer vision with python

Todo
Colorsplitter for wavelength
tkinter window with originl image, plus altered version.
Buttons for:
rgb split
choose color filter
gamma correct
edge
crop 10%

plan:
put walls for microscope slides to fit between, with markers (spheres?) to confirm distance: detect circles, calculate distance to camera
gamma correct
split colors
watershed?
Use auto canny detection
discard contours that dont make sense
detect distance from refs and area of drops
get extreme points
Calculate CA
calc volume, radius
mulitprocessing
save contour to video
